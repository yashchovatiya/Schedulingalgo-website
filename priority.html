            What is Priority Scheduling?
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Priority Scheduling</strong> is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority. </p>
        <p>The processes with higher priority should be carried out first, whereas jobs with equal priorities are carried out on a round-robin or FCFS basis. Priority depends upon memory requirements, time requirements, etc. </p>

        <h2 class="head">Characteristics of Priority Scheduling</h2>
        <ul><li>A CPU algorithm that schedules processes based on priority.</li><li>It used in Operating systems for performing batch processes.</li><li>If two jobs having the same priority are READY, it works on a FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED basis.</li><li>In priority scheduling, a number is assigned to each process that indicates its priority level. </li><li>Lower the number, higher is the priority.</li><li>In this type of scheduling algorithm, if a newer process arrives, that is having a higher priority than the currently running process, then the currently running process is preempted. </li></ul>

        <h2 class="head"></a>Advantages of priority scheduling</h2>
        <p>Here, are benefits/pros of using priority scheduling method: </p>
        <ul><li>Easy to use scheduling method </li><li>Processes are executed on the basis of priority so high priority does not need to wait for long which saves time</li><li>This method provides a good mechanism where the relative important of each process may be precisely defined. </li><li>Suitable for applications with fluctuating time and resource requirements.</li></ul>

        <h2 class="head">Summary:</h2>
        <ul><li>Priority scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority. </li><li>In Priority Preemptive Scheduling, the tasks are mostly assigned with their priorities.</li><li>In Priority Non-preemptive scheduling method, the CPU has been allocated to a specific process. </li><li>Processes are executed on the basis of priority so high priority does not need to wait for long which saves time</li><li>If high priority processes take lots of CPU time, then the lower priority processes may starve and will be postponed for an indefinite time.</li></ul>
