    <h2>
What is HRRN Method?
</h2>
    <p>Given n processes with their Arrival times and Burst times, the task is to find average waiting time and average turn around time using HRRN scheduling algorithm.</P>
    <P>The name itself states that we need to find the response ratio of all available processes and select the one with the highest Response Ratio. A process once selected will run till completion.</p>
    <p>Criteria – Response Ratio</p>
    <p>Mode – Non-Preemptive</p>
    <p>Response Ratio = (W + S)/S</p>
    <p>Here, W is the waiting time of the process so far and S is the Burst time of the process.</p>
    <p>Performance of HRRN</p>
    <li>Shorter Processes are favoured.</li>
    <li>Aging without service increases ratio, longer jobs can get past shorter jobs.</li>

<h2>Procedure of HRRN method</h2>
<li>It starts.</li>
<li>It only consider the processes with Arrival time, Burst Time and priority.</li>
<li>It fills the ready Queue according to arrival times.</li>
<li>Highest hybrid priority process is executed first using formula Hp = 0.5 * Ep + 0.5 * R</li>
<li>Steps 4 and 5 repeated until queue becomes empty.</li>
<li>Now, Calculate average waiting time, average turnaround time, number of context switches.</li>
<li>It stop.</li>


<h2>Advantages of HRRN</h2>
<li>It is Non-preemptive.</li>
<li>It prevents indefinite postponement (process of starvation).</li>
<li>It improves the performance of shortest process first scheduling.</li>
<li>It considers how long process has been waiting and increases its priority.</li>

<h2>Disadvantages of HRRN</h2>
<li>Burst time of the processes can not be known in advance so it can not be implemented practically.</li>
<li>Processes are scheduled by internal priority system because it does not support external priority system.</li>
